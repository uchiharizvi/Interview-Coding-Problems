# Practice Set A

1. Write a function in Java or Python to implement a stack. The stack should support the following operations:
   •	Push(x): Push element x onto the stack.
   •	Pop(): Removes the element from the top of the stack.
   •	Peek(): Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
   •	isEmpty(): Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.

2. You are asked to implement a queue using two stacks. Write a function in Java or Python to perform the following operations:
   •	Enqueue(x): Push element x into the queue.
   •	Dequeue(): Removes the element from the front of the queue.
